## Overview
The Handwritten Digits Recognizer is a machine learning application designed to classify handwritten digits from images. The project features a web interface built with Flask, allowing users to upload images and receive digit predictions.

### Live Demo
Check out the live demo of the project [here](https://handwritten-digits-recognizer.onrender.com/).

## Features
- üñºÔ∏è Upload and classify handwritten digit images.
- üîç Real-time predictions with a user-friendly web interface.

## Installation
To get started with the Handwritten Digits Recognizer, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/VarshaLenin12/VarshaLenin12-Handwritten_digits_recognizer.git
    cd VarshaLenin12-Handwritten_digits_recognizer
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Download the Model:**
   Ensure the trained model (`digit_recognition_model2.h5`) is in the root directory.

5. **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage
Once the application is running, access the web interface at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Upload an image of a handwritten digit and click "Predict" to get the classification result.
